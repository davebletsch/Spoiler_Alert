  - 150924 spoiler reviews

#### Technology Stack
  - Pandas
  - SKLearn

#### Process
  - EDA
  - Data Cleaning
  - Modeling
    -Model Mutations
      -Baseline (M1)
      -M2
      -M3
      -M4
#### Results
M4 does a good job of what we originally intented. It's accuracy is not ideal, however, the recall on the Spoilers group is 91%. Our model would prevent a potential viewer from read the vast majority of reviews but it would also unfortunately falsely label a large amount of Non-Spoilers as the Spoiler group.
#### Conclusions/Moving Foward
Neural Network/Deep Learning so the model can understand the actual meaning of the words.
